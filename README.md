# Ada Farm

Ada farm is a simple game where you play the farmer. Your job is to manage the farm, looking after the health of your animals and crops.

This repository is structured to run two farms side-by-side. The first is the farm that Ali is building as he leads the session. The second is your own farm, where you are encouraged to get creative and build on the ideas covered in class.

# How to work with this repository

** We are going to **

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a branch 
3. Create a new folder for your farm

This will allow us to all share each other's farms in this single repository.

## Step-by-step setup instructions

In the root of the project we have two folders: farmer-ali and farmer-jane

We have a shared package.json that includes serve to serve our farms over http, and mocha for running our tests. 

Clone the repository into a new folder on your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/adaapp/ada-farm.git my-new-farm`

Note that by adding "my-new-farm" at the end we can name the folder that is created.

`cd my-new-farm`

Create a new branch. This will allow you to build your own version of the farm whilst keeping up to date with the progress we make in the workshop inside example-farm:

`git checkout -b 'farmer-[your name]-progress'`

So for example Ali would type:

`git checkout -b 'farmer-ali-progress'`

Create a new folder called 'farmer-[your name]' alongside farmer-ali and farmer-jane. Copy across all the files from the original workshop into your new folder.

** make sure you don't copy across package.json, package-lock.json, or node_modules**
